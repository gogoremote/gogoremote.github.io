Global Paho.MQTT module\n// only has a single public function, client, which returns\n// a Paho.MQTT client object given connection details.\n\n/**\n * Send and receive messages using web browsers.\n * <p>\n * This programming interface lets a JavaScript client application use the MQTT V3.1 or\n * V3.1.1 protocol to connect to an MQTT-supporting messaging server.\n *\n * The function supported includes:\n * <ol>\n * <li>Connecting to and disconnecting from a server. The server is identified by its host name and port number.\n * <li>Specifying options that relate to the communications link with the server,\n * for example the frequency of keep-alive heartbeats, and whether SSL/TLS is required.\n * <li>Subscribing to and receiving messages from MQTT Topics.\n * <li>Publishing messages to MQTT Topics.\n * </ol>\n * <p>\n * The API consists of two main objects:\n * <dl>\n * <dt><b>{@link Paho.MQTT.Client}</b></dt>\n * <dd>This contains methods that provide the functionality of the API,\n * including provision of callbacks that notify the application when a message\n * arrives from or is delivered to the messaging server,\n * or when the status of its connection to the messaging server changes.</dd>\n * <dt><b>{@link Paho.MQTT.Message}</b></dt>\n * <dd>This encapsulates the payload of the message along with various attributes\n * associated with its delivery, in particular the destination to which it has\n * been (or is about to be) sent.</dd>\n * </dl>\n * <p>\n * The programming interface validates parameters passed to it, and will throw\n * an Error containing an error message intended for developer use, if it detects\n * an error with any parameter.\n * <p>\n * Example:\n *\n * <code><pre>\nclient = new Paho.MQTT.Client(location.hostname, Number(location.port), \"clientId\");\nclient.onConnectionLost = onConnectionLost;\nclient.onMessageArrived = onMessageArrived;\nclient.connect({onSuccess:onConnect});\n\nfunction onConnect() {\n  // Once a connection has been made, make a subscription and send a message.\n  console.log(\"onConnect\");\n  client.subscribe(\"/World\");\n  message = new Paho.MQTT.Message(\"Hello\");\n  message.destinationName = \"/World\";\n  client.send(message);\n};\nfunction onConnectionLost(responseObject) {\n  if (responseObject.errorCode !== 0)\n\tconsole.log(\"onConnectionLost:\"+responseObject.errorMessage);\n};\nfunction onMessageArrived(message) {\n  console.log(\"onMessageArrived:\"+message.payloadString);\n  client.disconnect();\n};\n * </pre></code>\n * @namespace Paho.MQTT\n */\n/* jshint shadow:true */\n(function ExportLibrary(root, factory) {\n\tif(typeof exports === 'object' && typeof module === 'object'){\n\t\tmodule.exports = factory();\n\t} else if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd){\n\t\tdefine(factory);\n\t} else if (typeof exports === 'object'){\n\t\texports = factory();\n\t} else {\n\t\tif (typeof root.Paho === 'undefined'){\n\t\t\troot.Paho = {};\n\t\t}\n\t\troot.Paho.MQTT = factory();\n\t}\n})(this, function LibraryFactory(){\n\n\nvar PahoMQTT = (function (global) {\n\n\t// Private variables below, these are only visible inside the function closure\n\t// which is used to define the module.\n\n\tvar version = \"@VERSION@\";\n\tvar buildLevel = \"@BUILDLEVEL@\";\n\n\t/**\n\t * Unique message type identifiers, with associated\n\t * associated integer values.\n\t * @private\n\t */\n\tvar MESSAGE_TYPE = {\n\t\tCONNECT: 1,\n\t\tCONNACK: 2,\n\t\tPUBLISH: 3,\n\t\tPUBACK: 4,\n\t\tPUBREC: 5,\n\t\tPUBREL: 6,\n\t\tPUBCOMP: 7,\n\t\tSUBSCRIBE: 8,\n\t\tSUBACK: 9,\n\t\tUNSUBSCRIBE: 10,\n\t\tUNSUBACK: 11,\n\t\tPINGREQ: 12,\n\t\tPINGRESP: 13,\n\t\tDISCONNECT: 14\n\t};\n\n\t// Collection of utility methods used to simplify module code\n\t// and promote the DRY pattern.\n\n\t/**\n\t * Validate an object's parameter names to ensure they\n\t * match a list of expected variables name for this option\n\t * type.
